This database compiles the run-up distance to detonation (xDDT) experimental data available in the literature from 1951 to 2024 in smooth channels and tubes.
The database includes different parameters of interest for each data point:
- Paper information: name, year, journal, authors, and country of authors' affiliation.
- Initial experimental conditions:  pressure, temperature, and mixture composition.
- Channel/tube information: hydraulic diameter, length, aspect ratio, ignition position, boundary condition, and cross-section type.
- Multiple fundamental combustion properties for each mixture
